'''
Every decimal number can be changed into its binary form. Suppose your computer has itâ€™s own Corona Virus, 
that eats binary digits from the right side of a number. 
Suppose a virus has 6 spikes, it will eat up 6 binary digits in your numbers. 
You will have a bunch of numbers, and your machine will have a virus with n spikes, 
you have to calculate what will be the final situation of the final numbers. 
First input, a single Integer N Second input space separated integers of the bunch of values Third input a single integer n, 
the number of spikes in Corona for Computer
